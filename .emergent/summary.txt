<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully took a base application and significantly expanded its features and deployment capabilities based on user requests. The work trajectory shows a clear progression from initial setup and understanding to implementing complex features like a client portal, dynamic LinkedIn feeds, and a Content Management System (CMS). A major portion of the effort was dedicated to resolving persistent deployment challenges with Render, shifting eventually to a hybrid GitHub Pages/Render backend setup for cost-effectiveness and reliability. The engineer consistently communicated plans, confirmed with the user, and troubleshooted effectively, adapting the architecture and deployment strategy as issues arose. Key decisions included moving to in-memory storage for the CMS due to MongoDB Atlas issues and leveraging GitHub Pages for the frontend due to Render's static site build complications. The current state is a functional, feature-rich application hosted on a hybrid environment.

<product_requirements>
The user initially tasked the AI engineer with analyzing and fixing URL issues without immediate deployment. The core product evolved significantly through iterative requests.
**Initial Request:** Analyze code for URL issues and await deployment confirmation.
**Feature Enhancements:**
1.  **Client Portal:** Integrate client status check-in/case status feature and allow inquiry submissions. This includes a dedicated page () with real-time backend connectivity status, check-in functionality, and status history display.
2.  **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Implement a reusable breadcrumb component and integrate it into key pages like Portail Client, Presentation, Actualités, and Honoraires for improved navigation.
3.  **Favicon Change:** Update the site's favicon to a custom design.
4.  **Dynamic LinkedIn Feed:** Completely refactor the Actualités page to display direct LinkedIn feeds instead of static content, including engagement statistics (later removed).
5.  **Content Management System (CMS):** Build a backend CMS to allow easy content modification for site pages (e.g., site title, contact info, colors, dynamic pages). This includes a frontend administration interface.
**Deployment Requirements:**
1.  User requested a preview environment.
2.  User asked for direct GitHub deployment.
3.  User requested the cheapest possible deployment solution, leading to a focus on Render's free/hobby tier.
4.  User specified deploying to  branch.
5.  User requested the CMS access URL to be changed from  to .
6.  User requested removal of the Portail Client section from the contact page and then completely from the site's header navigation.

npm@10.8.2 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm for build reliability on Render.
-   ****: Added  for platform identification.
-   ****: Updated  to  to align with Vite's environment variable naming convention. This handles API calls from the frontend.
-   ****:
    -   Initially used  for MongoDB.
    -   Modified to use in-memory lists/dictionaries for status checks and CMS content due to persistent MongoDB connection issues on Render, simplifying dependencies.
    -   Introduced  endpoints for client check-ins.
    -   Introduced  endpoints for managing pages and settings.
-   ****: Created as a centralized service layer for making API calls, using . This standardizes API interactions.
-   ****: New component for the client check-in form and status display, interacting with the backend API.
-   ****: New page to integrate the  component, providing the main interface for clients.
-   ****: Routes added for  and . The  route was later removed.
-   ****: Added PORTAIL CLIENT link for desktop and mobile navigation, later completely removed based on user request.
-   ****: New custom SVG favicon created.

<pending_tasks>
-   Re-implement persistent storage for CMS and Client Portal (e.g., re-integrate MongoDB Atlas or another database) as the current implementation uses in-memory storage.
-   Add authentication/authorization to the CMS admin interface for security.
-   Ensure all existing content is migrated into the CMS, as currently it only supports new dynamic pages.
-   Compare all pages and components with the provided Lovable reference URL to ensure exact content and component parity.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on ensuring that the GitHub Pages deployment of the frontend correctly displayed all React pages and that the CMS was accessible via the main domain.

The current state of the product is:
*   **Frontend Deployment (Public Site):** Successfully deployed on GitHub Pages at . This site now correctly serves the React application, including the previously problematic client-side routes like , thanks to the  and  routing fixes.
*   **Backend Deployment (APIs & CMS):** Successfully deployed on Render.com at . The backend is currently configured to use in-memory storage for client status and CMS data, as direct MongoDB integration (both Render's native and MongoDB Atlas) encountered persistent issues. This means data is not persistent across restarts.
*   **CMS Access:** The CMS administration interface is accessible on the main domain at . It interacts with the Render-hosted backend. While it works, any data created will be lost if the backend restarts.
*   **Client Portal:** The Client Portal feature is accessible on the main domain at . It also relies on the in-memory backend.
*   **Navigation:** The Portail Client links and sections have been entirely removed from the public-facing website navigation and contact page as per the user's request. The  route is intended for internal use.
*   **Favicon:** Updated with a custom SVG.
*   **Actualités Page:** Refactored to display a dynamic LinkedIn feed.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Implemented on key pages.

The previous conversation ended with the user providing a Lovable URL and asking to compare all pages to ensure the exact same content and components, indicating that the core functionality is now expected to be in place.

<optional_next_step>
My next step is to analyze the user's current website against the provided Lovable reference URL to ensure content and component parity across all pages.
